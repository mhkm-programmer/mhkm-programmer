I have experience with UI/UX design, using tools like Figma and Adobe XD to create intuitive user interfaces.

My proficiency in Node.js and Express.js enables me to build scalable and efficient server applications. I have hands-on experience with databases like MongoDB and MySQL, implementing robust data models and handling complex queries. Additionally, I am familiar with RESTful API development, authentication and authorization protocols, and server deployment using tools like Docker and AWS.

These skills include version control with Git, task automation with Webpack and Gulp, testing frameworks like Jest and Mocha, and knowledge of DevOps practices for continuous integration and deployment.
